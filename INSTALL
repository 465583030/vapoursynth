Installation
------------

First, a couple of things to note:

* You need to be on Linux or OS X. A BSD might work too.
* You need autotools, probably recent versions.
* You need to have the libraries and headers for libavutil,
  libavcodec, and libswscale installed.
* You need to have either GCC or Clang installed.
  Both a C and C++ compiler are required.
* You need to have Yasm installed.
* You need Python 3 for VSScript and to build the Python module.
* You need to have Cython installed in your Python 3 environment.
* You need Sphinx if you want to build the documentation.

The usual sequence of commands works:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

This will build the core, the Python module, VSScript, vspipe, and all
the plugins that are enabled by default. See ./configure --help.

The documentation can be built using its own Makefile:

    $ make -C doc/ html

The documentation can be installed using the standard program `cp`.

Probably only the plugins can be cross-compiled with Mingw-w64.
