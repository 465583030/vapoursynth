Needs Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 with vsyasm (yasm for use with VS2010)
Note that yasm 1.3.0 may need to have one configuration file changed to fix the "-f win32" case sensitivity issue
The proper paths to put things in are:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin
C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V140\BuildCustomizations
It also needs both 32 and 64 bit Python 3.5 series with cython installed for both
(also needs sphinx and sphinx-intl to generate docs)
Inno setup is needed to create the installer

Clone VapourSynth
Clone zimg v2.2 branch into the VapourSynth dir
Compile 32 and 64 bit release using the VapourSynth solution
Run cython_build.bat to compile the Python modules

In order to build the installer you need to download
and place isxdl.dll in "installer\scripts\isxdl".
It can be downloaded from:
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20868/NET-Framework-Installer-for-InnoSetup

There are also a few plugins that aren't included
which are easier to simply retrieve from an existing
VapourSynth installation.
